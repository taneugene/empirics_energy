# Empirical Analysis of Energy Markets - U6616
## Empirical Exercise I - Data Exploration - Answer Key

### Intro 

This problem set is due on October 2. I strongly recommend to start working on the homework early. I would suggest to plan on completing the first two parts by September 20. You can work in pairs and submit a common solution. Please submit the homework as an R markdown file (if there are data files, they put all the files in a zip file). The code must run without errors. To make this easier, set the working directory at the beginning so it can be easily changed by someone else running the code.

The purpose of this dataset is to analyze how the capacity of different fuels used to generate electricity in the United States has changed over time. We will also look at how emissions of different pollutants have changed and think about potential links between the two.

### Question 1
Start at the [EIA Electric Power Annual](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/).

#### First download Tables 4.2.A and 4.2.B., which contain capacity by source over time.

I do this using code, but you could have just downloaded the excel files normally and put them in your R working directory (you figure this out by writing `getwd()`, or opening a new project in a particular folder) to complete this part. 

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Put the urls in a variable
urls <- c("https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/xls/epa_04_02_a.xlsx","https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/xls/epa_04_02_b.xlsx")

# Where do I want to store the data and outputs for the whole exercise?
# educational note: "." means current working directory, check your current working directory with getwd()
data_folder <- "data" 
output_folder <- "output"


download_file <- function(url){
  #' Function to download and unzip.
  # Input
  print(url)
  # file name
  print(basename(url))
  # concatenate the filename to your data storage
  fname <- file.path(data_folder, basename(url))
  print(fname)
  # If the file doesn't exist download it, otherwise just return where it's stored.
  if (!file.exists(fname)){
    download.file(url, fname)
  }
  return(fname)
}

# Create those folders if they don't exist
invisible(dir.create(file.path(".", data_folder), showWarnings = T))
invisible(dir.create(file.path(".", output_folder), showWarnings = T))

# Use the function
fnames <- c(download_file(urls[1]),download_file(urls[2]))
```
#### Load the files to R and describe each variable. Make sure to use the appropriate class for each variable.

* Loading the files is easiest using the 'import dataset' function, or navigating to the file in the lower right hand side, finding and clicking the file and hitting import dataset from the drop-down menu.
* By use the appropriate class, we mean that the data type of the variable should be appropriate for analysis. 
* Anticipating the future questions, you only needed to load the first 12 rows of each file. 
* You could describe each variable in the data-type sense with `str()`, or in the statistical sense with `summary()`. Bonus points given for doing both. 
* Using int or date are both acceptable for dealing with years (ints are easier, the advantage of dates is allowing you to deal with leap years, counting number of days across years and months, etc)

##### Describe each variable:
Year is self-described, each of the other columns is the capacity in MW for each energy source. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Load the files to R
invisible(a <- read_excel(fnames[1], skip = 2, n_max = 12))
invisible(b <- read_excel(fnames[2], skip = 4, n_max = 12))

# Use data.table
a <- as.data.table(a)
b <- as.data.table(b)

# Drop unnecessary rows
a <- a[!1]
b <- b[!1]

# Use appropriate classes - I'll show 2 methods to do this column by column
# a Base-r method (this doesn't require data.table)
a$`Estimated Photovoltaic` <- as.numeric(a$`Estimated Photovoltaic`)
a$Year <- as.integer(a$Year)
# a data.table method :=
b[,Year := as.integer(Year)]
b[,`Estimated Small Scale Photovoltaic` := as.numeric(`Estimated Small Scale Photovoltaic`)]

# This reports a description of datatypes for table a
str(a)
# This reports a description of datatypes for table b
str(b)

# This reports summary statistics for table a
summary(a)
# This reports summary statistics for table b
summary(b)
```


#### What is capacity? Make sure you understand the difference between capacity and generation.

*Capacity* The maximum electric power output (rate of energy generation, or energy over time) that can be output from a power plant. 

These datasets use 'Net Summer Capacity', which is ["the maximum output, commonly expressed in megawatts (MW), that generating equipment can supply to system load, as demonstrated by a multi-hour test, at the time of summer peak demand (period of June 1 through September 30."](https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=net%20summer%20capacity)


*Generation* is a measure of energy, not power (the derivative of energy over time), and is calculated with a formula like this:
  
$$\sum_i power_i*time_i $$
  
where each i refers to a different level of power generation that can be of any length. For example, if a 10MW natural gas plant produces its capacity (10MW) for 12 hours, half-capacity (5MW) for 6 hours, and is turned off for 6 hours, the generation is:

$$ 10MW*12h + 5MW * 6h + 0MW*6h = 150MWh.$$
  
Another term you hear relating these tho things is the **capacity factor**, which unintuitively is a ratio of actual *generation* over the *total theoretical generation*. Using the same example, the total theoretical annual generation of the 10MW natural gas plant is $10MW *24hrs/day*365 days/year$, so if in a year the plant produces 40000MWh of energy, its capacity factor would be $$\frac{40000MWh}{10 MW * 24hrs/day*365 days/year} = 45.6\% $$.

#### Plot total capacity over time. How has this changed?

Extra points for readable/converted units, and for x scale that doesn't have .5s. 

Total capacity increases over time, From 2008 - 2012, in increases by about 50 GW, and from 2015 to 2018 it increases by about 35 GW. It stays about constant from 2012-2016.  The increases put together only constitute about 8% of the initial capacity. 

```{r}
# Make the plot GW for more readability!
plot1 <- ggplot(a , mapping = aes(x = Year, y = `Utility Total`/1000))+
  geom_line()+
  # Zoomed in version
  # limits set the bounds of the y axis
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Utility Capacity (GW)", limits = c(1000,1100)) + 
  # make every year labeled
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) + 
  ggtitle("Total capacity over time 2008-2018")
ggsave("output/capacity2008-2018.png")

# Show the absolute value on the y axis so you don't exagerrate the difference.
# If you are using the same data, you can overwrite parameters for the plot this way:
plot2 <- plot1 + scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Utility Capacity (GW)", limits = c(0,1100))
ggsave("output/capacity_absolute2008-2018.png")
plot2
```

#### Plot the share of capacity from the different sources over time. How has this changed?

It's really important here to realize that we ask you to use both tables, and that means you don't want to double count.  High-level algorithm:
1. Join tables
2. Remove double-counted columns
3. Plot share using a stacked bar or area graph

It's nice to use intuitive colors for fuels. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
# These aren't necessary because dt is smart, but you should set keys before joins to build good habits
setkey(a, Year)
setkey(b, Year)
# Join
dt1 <- merge(a,b)
dt1

# Remove double counted columns and totals
# Print possible columns
# names(dt1)


# List of sources you should remove
remove <- c("Utility Total","Estimated Photovoltaic","Other Renewable Sources","\r\nTotal Utility (Other Renewable Sources)","Total Solar Photovoltaic","Total Solar")


# Syntax tip
# DT[,Cols.Chosen:=NULL] Delete the column with column name Cols.chosen
# DT[,(Cols.Chosen):=NULL] Delete the columns specified in the variable Cols.chosen

# Remove these columns
dt1[,(remove) := NULL]

# Melt the columns down to plot
dt1 <- melt(dt1, "Year")
dt1

# You might get this error: 	Removed 6 rows containing missing values (position_stack),
# that's because there's no data for Estimated Small Scale Photovoltaic before 2014. 
dt1[is.na(value)]

# You can reasonably assume it's 0
dt1[is.na(value), value := 0]

# Plot
# There's a color cheat sheet here, or you can use hex codes if you know them 
# http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour
ggplot(dt1, aes(x = Year, y = value/1000, fill = variable)) + 
  geom_area() +  
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks= 10) + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Capacity (GW)") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Energy Source", values=c("chocolate4", "black", "gray79","gray22", 'lightgoldenrod','cornflowerblue',"cadetblue1", "coral4", 'aliceblue','gold', "orange","tan4", 'brown2', "seagreen", "gold2"))
ggsave(file.path(output_folder, 'part1_capacity.pdf'), width = 16, height = 9)
```



### Question 2
Now we will obtain data on emissions over time. For this, follow [this link](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/index.php?tbl=T11.06) to the EIA Monthly Energy Review. Section 11 contains data on many emissions sources, but just download the data set on carbon emissions from energy consumption in the electric power sector (11.6).

There was some confusion about this filetype - T11.06 is in fact a csv/excel file depending on which version you downloaded. But it didn't have the .xls or .csv at the end of the file, so some detective work was needed to figure this out.  Either loading it directly, or changing the filename to add .csv or .xls at the end was necessary.  

### Load the files to R and describe each variable. Make sure to use the appropriate class for each variable.
This question needs either a datatype description or a statistical description.  YYYYMM could be int, could be parsed to a date, or split into two ints. 


```{r}
 ##################
# Emissions by year

# Download the file using the function defined in q1.
fname <- download_file("https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/csv.php?tbl=T11.06")

# Load a csv
em <-  fread(fname)

# data type and statistical description
str(em)
summary(em)
em
```

```{r}
# Get the year and month by getting the quotient and remainder after dividing by 100
em[, `:=`(year = YYYYMM%/%100, month =  YYYYMM%%100)]
# Get the annual data which is coded as the 13th month in this dataset
em <-  em[!grepl('total',Description, ignore.case = TRUE) & month==13]
# Check everything is in the same units, convert to factor
em[,c('Unit', 'Description','Value'):= list(as.factor(Unit),as.factor(Description),as.numeric(Value))]
# Make missing values 0
em[is.na(Value), Value := 0]
```

#### Plot total emissions over time. How have they changed?

Total Emissions from the electricity grid have risen slowly by about 1 billion metric tons since the 1970s until a peak in 2005. Then it falls back to the 1970s levels in 2020 'decarbonization'.  Note that this isn't total energy in the US, but just power plants.  The transport sector has not decarbonized by as much. 

The difference between this and the next question is to just to a line graph and a stacked area/bar chart separately. Bonus points for relabelling axes to billion metric tons, marks for title, axes labels.

```{r echo = TRUE}
setkey(em, year)
em_total <- em[,.(`Total Emissions`=sum(Value)),by = key(em)]
ggplot(em_total, aes(x = year, y = `Total Emissions`/1000)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Emissions (Billion Metric Tons of CO2)", limits = c(0,3)) + 
  ggtitle('2b) Emissions over time 1973-2017')
```


#### Plot the share of emissions from the different sources over time. How has this changed? How do you relate this to what you observed in the previous question?
Since 2005, natural gas has rapidly increased while coal has decreased.  This has meant that electricity generation has substituted coal emissions for natural gas emissions. We can't tell whether coal plants have totally been replaced or not yet, that's part 3 - is the drop in emissions due to coal being replaced by natural gas? or renewables? What proportion?

```{r}
# Plot emissions over time by technology of generator
ggplot(em, aes(x= year, y = Value/1000, fill = Description))+
  geom_area(position = 'stack') +
  ggtitle("2c) United States CO2 Emissions from Power Plants by Technology and Year", subtitle = "source: EIA-860 data") +
  ylab("Billion Metric Tons of CO2") +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Power Plant Technology", values=c("chocolate4", "black", 'brown2',"gray79","coral4","chocolate4","black","gray22"))
ggsave(file.path(output_folder, 'emissions.pdf'), width = 16, height = 9)
```
### Question 3
Since the previous dataset only had capacity for 10 years, the next step is to download data from EIA Form 860 to build capacity for a period as long as the one for emissions.

#### Follow the steps covered during recitation to build the total capacity of source for each year.

These are just the steps from recitation, I end up showing students part 3a-c. 

##### Download and unzip file
```{r echo = TRUE}

# This dataset is no longer the early release version!
url <- "https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/xls/eia8602019.zip"

# I want a variable for the name of my data folder
data_folder <-  "data"
# Create the folde if it doesn't exist
dir.create(file.path(".", data_folder), showWarnings = T)
# Get the path of the file when it is stored on disk
fname <- file.path(data_folder, basename(url))
fname
# If the file doesn't exist already, download from the URL (the web) to the path (your computer's folder called data, relative to your working directory)
if (!file.exists(fname)){
  download.file(url, fname)
}
# Unzip the folder 
unzip(fname, exdir = data_folder)
```
##### Look and examine the data
![](../../img/eia860.png)

* What is the difference between 1, 2 and 3? 

the relevant data is in 3

* What is the difference between 3.1 and 3.2...

"Additional Details" are in 3_2+, these we don't need because the capacity, technology, and the operating and retirement years are in 3_1.

* Look at the data we want, is it sufficient to answer the question?

...build capacity for a period as long as the one for emissions

##### Assumption

We don't need any more data. Assume:

 * All power plants in 'Operable' are still 'active' and have been active since "Operating Year"
 * All power plants in 'Retired and Cancelled' were 'active' from "Operating Year" until "Retirement Year", and that this dataset is exhaustive.
 * Power plant capacity in any given year is the total capacity of 'active' plants. 
 
 
##### 2 methods
* Have a column with active status...
* Keep a running tally for each fuel and year. 
* What is the minimum dataset we need for each method?

##### High-level algorithm for the running tally method

My ideal dataset has a cumulative capacity for each technology-year pair. 

1. For all those power plants are operable, we assume they are active up until the current year, so they never go offline. 
1. For all those power plants in 'Retired and Cancelled', we assume they are active between their operating and retirement years; if there's no data, we just assume they are cancelled and never operated.  
1. Get the sum of Power Plant Capacity that came online in each year from the Operating Year column - 'additions' - by technology.
1. Get the sum of Power Plant Capacity that was retired/came offline from the Retirement Year column - 'subtractions' - in each year by technology.
1. The 'net capacity change' for each technology-year pair is additions less subtractions.
1. Running a cumulative sum over the years by technology will give me the total capacity by technology in each year. 
  
##### Join vs Concatenate?

* Concatenating (rbindlist) is stacking two datasets
* Joining (merge, join) is putting two datsets next to each other 
* Which do we want to do here?

Concatenate

* Which columns are important to do correctly?

The minimum dataset has Operating Year, Retirement Year, Nameplate Capacity (MW), and Technology. 

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Read in the data after unzipping
fname <- file.path(data_folder, "3_1_Generator_Y2019.xlsx")

# Import the excel sheet using Import Dataset in RStudio.
operable <-  as.data.table(read_excel(fname, sheet = "Operable", skip = 1, na = 'NA'))
# Look at structure
str(operable)
# View the table
head(operable)

# Count how many nas there are
sum(is.na(operable$`Operating Year`)) # base r version
operable[,sum(is.na(`Operating Year`))] # data.table version, both work, this is better

# View the rows for which there  there's no operating year. 
operable[is.na(`Operating Year`),] 

# Get the second sheet
retired <-  as.data.table(read_excel(fname, sheet = "Retired and Canceled", skip = 1, na = 'NA'))
str(retired)
# Count how many nas there are using the data table method
retired[,sum(is.na(`Operating Year`))] # These are all cancelled plants
retired[,sum(is.na(`Retirement Year`))] # there are 2 retired plants that don't have a retirement year, why? You could assume these retired in 2019, but I don't in this sketch.

# Try binding

# Look up ?rbindlist if you haven't already
# The first parameter is list
# use.names makes you match columns based on their names instead of column order
# Fill is to fill 'retirement Year' in the operable sheet with NAs.
# idcol provides a column in df (for dataframe) with the list-position of the dataset it came from.  i.e. if you call df$.id it'll show 1s and 2s. 1s mean it comes from operable, and 2s mean that it came from retired.
df <-  rbindlist(list(operable, retired), use.names = T, fill =  T, idcol = T)
# Same checks for nulls, note how these numbers change
df[,sum(is.na(`Operating Year`))]
df[,sum(is.na(`Retirement Year`))] # Many nulls because none of the operable plants have been retired yet!
df<- df[!is.na(`Operating Year`)] # filter only those with an operating year
str(df)
```

##### Get the right data types

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Convert all columns which are labelled with 'Plant Code', has 'MW', 'Year', or 'Month' to numeric data type.
num_cols <-  colnames(df)[grep("MW|Plant Code|Year|Month|Factor|Buoys", colnames(df), ignore.case=T)]
# Trick I showed last class to apply something over a bunch of columns. See the alternative there if you don't understand this
df[, (num_cols):= lapply(.SD, as.numeric), .SDcols = num_cols]
# The above 2 lines are *VERY FANCY*, I explained them in recitation 3. 
# You can also convert the columns one by one using code like this, which may be easier to understand
df[,`Nameplate Capacity (MW)`:=as.numeric(`Nameplate Capacity (MW)`)]
```

##### Change the column names for easy access
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Print the columns of df so I know what I am looking for
colnames(df)
# Rename these for easy access
df[,upyear := `Operating Year`]
df[,downyear := `Retirement Year`]
df[,capacity :=`Nameplate Capacity (MW)`]
```


##### Get a sum of new and retiring capacity year on year (new variable) by technology
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Set a 'key' for df
# In response to Gabriel's question, I don't explicitly actually use this line
# But I will set keys later that I do use!
setkey(df, upyear, Technology)
# View the key - this is just a list of columns for easy access.
key(df)
# One-line data.table query. by parameter:
# i = choose only the rows which have we have a year for which they come online
# j = create a column called year which is equal to upyear (this is to join with subtract later), and a column called 'capacity additions' which is the sum of capacities.
# by = I don't want to sum across the whole dataset for capacities, I only want to do so in groups, which is the operating year-technology pair.  
add <- df[!is.na(upyear),.(year = upyear,capacity_additions = sum(capacity,na.rm = T)), by = .(upyear, Technology)]

# Same code, I could have done the same thing using the key
add <- df[!is.na(upyear),.(year = upyear,capacity_additions = sum(capacity,na.rm = T)), by = key(df)]

# Same as making add, only I'm grouping the power plants by the years they come offline rather than online. 
subtract <-  df[!is.na(downyear),.(year = downyear,capacity_subtractions = sum(capacity,na.rm = T)), by = .(downyear, Technology)]
# view em
add
subtract
```

##### Join the additions and subtractions
```{r echo = TRUE}

## Use expand_grid to make sure that there's a key for every year
## (this is easy to overlook until you plot)
## The purpose of this is so you don't have NAs in your dataset - I want solar in 1893 to be 0, not NA, but this wouldn't be given by the add or subtract data.tables. 
# check ?expand_grid
# This is called an 'index' or 'key'
cap <- as.data.table(expand_grid('year' = min(add[,year]):max(add[,year]), 'Technology' = unique(add[,Technology])))
## Check out what this looks like
head(cap)
tail(cap)

# The purpose of the key is so that things can join later. Merges and Joins in data,table require that keys are the same so it knows which rows correspond to which other rows in two different datasets. 

## Set keys - note that it's year-Technology now so that the two tables match, instead of operating_year-technology and retirement_year-technology pairs. 
setkey(add, year, Technology)
setkey(subtract, year, Technology)
# Set the key to be the same as (capacity) additions and subtractions above
setkey(cap, year, Technology)


## Sense check - this commented-out code was for an early version of the dataset where there were some 0s in operating year
# add <- add[upyear !=0] 
## Use expand_grid to make sure that there's a key for every year
## (this is easy to overlook until you plot)
# cap <- as.data.table(expand_grid('year' = min(add[,year]):max(add[,year]), 'Technology' = unique(add[,Technology])))
# setkey(cap, year, Technology)

## now merge in the additions and subtractions
# I'm merging the additions and subtractions, all and all.x is equivalent to an outer join which means I keep ALL rows across the two tables. If I didn't do this I'd get back only those columns for which a technology-year pair had both power plants retiring and coming online.
add_subtract <-merge(add, subtract, all = TRUE)
# now I'm merging them with the index that I've defined. I'm doing a left-join here with all.x = TRUE, which means I only want to keep the index of the left dataset (my first parameter, in this case cap). This means that any rows in add_subtract without a corresponding index in the key of cap would be discarded. 
cap <-  merge(cap, add_subtract,all.x = TRUE)
# View the top 50 rows. There's a lot of NAs since many technologies did not exist in 1891.
head(cap,50)
```

#### Plot total capacity over time. How has this changed?

Total capacity grows over time a lot! It seems to follow an S-curve until the year 2000 from 0 to 800GW, and then jumps up again by 1.5x. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
## So if there were no additions or subtractions in a year of a technology, set to 0.
cap[is.na(capacity_additions), capacity_additions:= 0]
cap[is.na(capacity_subtractions), capacity_subtractions:= 0]
# Calculate the net capacity change = additions - subtractions
cap_final <- cap[,.(net_capacity_change = capacity_additions-capacity_subtractions), by = key(cap)]
# Take a cumulatie sum over the years by technology.  Note here that because year is the first value of my key, the cumulative sum knows to sum over it. 
cap_final[, capacity := cumsum(net_capacity_change), by = Technology]
cap_final
```

```{r echo = TRUE}
cap_total <-  cap_final[, .(total_capacity = sum(capacity)), year ]

ggplot(cap_total, aes(x = year, y = `total_capacity`/1000)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total Capacity (GW)", limits = c(0,1250)) + 
  ggtitle("3b) Total Capacity over time")

tail(cap_total)
```

#### Plot the share of capacity from the different sources over time. How has this changed?

In the next 3 code blocks I spend a bunch of time matching colors to different fuels and aggregating the technologies to form less granular, more high-level groups. This wasn't necessary, but it was good to make the colors intuitive for a reader.  

It was not necessary to filter the dataset to 1973 until the last step, but it tells an exciting story if you don't! In the pre 1910s, everything was hydroelectric. Then fossil fuels took off in the 1940s, and nuclear followed in the 1960s. If you take the stacked bar graph as a proportion, the minimum renewable % seems to have been in about 2005 which is surprising! and wind and solar only started recently, now together comprising about 10% of capacity. Most peole won't know off the top of their head what [combined cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_cycle_power_plant) is - so if they explained this this was good!


```{r echo = TRUE}
# Change tech to a factor so that categories work for plotting
cap_final[,Technology:= as.factor(Technology)]
# view it
tail(cap_final)
```

```{r echo = TRUE}

# Set colors to use for plotting graphs
## Set high level groups
color_key = list('other' = 'coral',
                 "coal" = "chocolate4",
                 'petroleum' = "black",
                 'gas' = "gray79",
                 'combined cycle' = 'gray22',
                 'waste' = 'red4',
                 'nuclear' = 'lightgoldenrod',
                 'hydro' = 'cornflowerblue',
                 'wind' = 'aliceblue',
                 'solar' = 'gold',
                 'geothermal' = 'brown2'
                 )
## Get a list of technologies
techs <-  unique(cap_final$Technology)
## Make a hash lookup for the set of 27 techs
colors <-  rep('coral', length(techs))
colors <-  setNames(colors, techs)
## Aggregate by types
cap_final[, tech := "other"]
cap_final[, color := "coral"]
## loop through the big categories and search for them in the technologies.
for (fuel in names(color_key)){
  # Make a second key for the 27 techs
  colors[grep(fuel,techs,ignore.case = TRUE)] = color_key[fuel]
  # add a column with the 10 techs
  cap_final[grep(fuel,Technology,ignore.case = TRUE), tech:=fuel]
  # add a column for the color
  cap_final[grep(fuel,Technology,ignore.case = TRUE), color:=color_key[fuel]]
}

# change tech to a factor(categories)
cap_final[,tech:= as.factor(tech)]
# reorder in order of pollution levels
cap_final[,tech := factor(cap_final[,tech],levels = names(color_key))]

### Question 4

Suppose you are interested in the causal effect of coal capacity on carbon emissions and you want to use the dataset you just build to estimate it.

#### Run a regression of carbon emissions on coal capacity and present your results using the stargazer package. Use robust standard errors.

This should be straightforward - filter, merge, and then run the regression.

```{r}
# First we need to join the two datasets
coal <- cap_agg[tech == "coal"]
# Setting the key means it knows which rows to merge
setkey(coal, year)
# 
coal <- merge(coal, em_total)

# Make the fit the base r way
fit_1 <- lm(`Total Emissions` ~ capacity, data = coal)
# These are the standard errors that should be reported, but see starprep for the next ways.  
lm_robust(`Total Emissions` ~ capacity, data = coal)

# use starprep (from the estimatr library) to uses lm_robust defaults for standard errors (robust HC2 SEs are the default in both lm_robust). 
# See https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/regression-tables.html#stargazer
# Then compare the two regressions.
stargazer(fit_1, se = starprep(fit_1), type = 'text')
```

#### Does the previous regression capture the causal effect of coal capacity on carbon emissions? Why? If there is bias, do you expected to go in a particular direction? Explain.

We do expect to see the effect of coal capacity on emissions, because we understand a causal mechanism through which capacity affects emissions - through generation. So the regression captures some causal effect.  The explanation of causality requires a mechanism, just because it's biased does not mean it's not causal. 

On the other hand, *identification of the causal effect* does depend on bias. We call this 'establishing causality'. In this case, we have a bunch of other fuels which bias the result - other fuels like natural gas also produces emissions, and these also increase total emissions.  This means that the coefficient is upward biased (it is too high!).

#### Are there any controls you could add to correct this problem? Explain. You don’t have to run more regressions, just to discuss how you would do it assuming you had access to typically available data.

You could add a controls for all of the other fuels, fuel prices, demand etc for things that affect coal generation.
