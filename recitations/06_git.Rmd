## Outline for today
* Version Control
* Git commits as snapshots
* A sequence of commits as version history
* Repositories
* Collaborating on github
* Troubleshooting - commits at the same time
  * merging
  * rebasing
  
## Version Control

* Emailing your file back and forth
* Working over zoom
* Time difference

## Version Control

Git solves this problem for code.
Code is different from normal writing because your end depends on your beginning. 

* Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.
* Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.
* Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.

## Version Control

Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.

As a manager - you can see who introduced bugs
As a coder - you can always rewind back to the last time you had the code working
