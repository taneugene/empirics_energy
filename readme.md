# INAF6616 Empirical Analysis of Energy Markets - TA material
Eugene Tan

## Outliner
One of the goals of the class is to learn to analyze data using R.  We don't assume previous knowledge, and we are going to use a combination of datacamp, empirical exercises and recitations.  This GitHub Repository is going to be where I put all the material for TA sessions, which mostly should be in the form of a R Markdown file (.Rmd), and homeworks (including answer keys).

## What I cover in TA sessions
Datacamp is great at teaching you commands and the data structures that R uses.
But in terms of using it to conduct analysis, it generally walks you through the exercises with a close watch.  
So first, some of my TA sessions will be thinking about how to approach and break down programming and analytical problems, as well as where to find help online.
Second, datacamp obviously isn't specific to energy, so I'll supplement stuff you should have covered there sometimes with an example in energy.
Third, it's also designed with aspiring data analysts and scientists in mind. 
Data science as a field generally evolved out a place where you have large-n, independent and identically distributed (iid) data. 
We can't often make those assumptions in energy economics, so we use slightly different tools.
As we cover those tools during lecture, I'll supplement that with material that will teach you how to program those in R. 
Finally, if there's interest, I'm happy to teach simple and useful non-R data science and programming skills that might help you collaborate better (git and Github) and use your computer more effectively (Unix).
